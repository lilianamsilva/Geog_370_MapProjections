    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Description</h2>
    <p>I downloaded the Cultural Vector Layer off of Natural Earth. I then exported that layer into QGIS. 
        I had already installed Indicatrix mapper as a pluggin into QGIS. This helped me in finding the cap and line segments for each projecttion.
        Next, I would click onto the project properties to see which projection I wanted the certain layer to be in.
        If I did not find the certain Authority ID right away, I would use the filter option. This would then limit my options.
        I would then click on my preffered/required projection and apply it to the map. This lead the layer to contort to the specified coordinates
        Last, I made it an image with the layer function and exported it as a png to my maps folder. I continued to do this for each projection.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection has a linear scale.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: Preserves the area, angles, and directions.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: The area is distorted around the poles to try and keep the original length of each land.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff Projection is to take the shape of an ellipse.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: The scale along the equator and meridian are correct.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: Mostly everything is distorted as you move from the equator and meridian.</h3>

    <h2>Psuedo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The Psuedo Mercator has a linear scale that is equal in all directions.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: Preserves the angles and directions.</h3> 
    <h3>Cons: As we get further from the equator, the lands closer to the poles begin to distort causing unreliable areas.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant is a projection from the North Pole.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: All the angles between the lines are equal. The lines from the poles are true to real time.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: The land distortion becomes greater as you grow farther from the poll.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Winkel I projection is coordinates using the arithmetic mean</h3>
    <h3>Pros: The curves and angles are equally spaced. The sizes and shape of the land areas are close to the sphere lands.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: The sizes and lands are distorted as to try to keep the angles and distance.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>It is good for large-sclae mapping but not for small-scale. The areas surrounding the lines are closest to the same values.</h3>
    <h3>Pros:It keeps the sizes equal of the areas.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: It still distorts the land shapes and angles.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>The World Equidistant Conic is good for regions that are in dimensions going from west-east.</h3> 
    <h3>Pros: The directions and distances are good towards the north pole.</h3>
    <h3>Con: It does not show the whole "globe." This one gets cut off. There are extreme distortions to the hemispheres and areas.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Quartic Authalic</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Quartic Authalic is an equal-area map that is a distribution of spherical variables for the coordinates.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: Equal area all through out the map and distances.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: Distortion of lands.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Robinson</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Robinson is a very unique projection. It tries to use the least amount of distortion.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: The distance latitude wise is close to the sphereical coordinates.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: Distorts all areas: shape, area, distance, angles, and direction. The area distorition gorws with the latitude but does not change with the longitude.</h3>
